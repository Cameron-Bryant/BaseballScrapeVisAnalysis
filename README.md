# BaseballScrapeVisAnalysis
To analyze data  from the web, there are 3 main steps
1. Scraping and Structuring
2. Visualizing/Exploring the data
3. Analyzing and making conclusions from the data
In this project I will analyze the stats of some of the best players in baseball right now. 
The file ScrapingAndSaving is step one. It scrapes the data from the MLB Website and save it into an excel file for easy access and performance
The vis and analysis file is a simple analysis of the data
the GUI/App is going to be an interactive, user-controlled way of vising and analyzing the data
